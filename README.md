# Malaria-Cell-Image-Detection
The purpose of this project is to analyse the images of human cells using convolutional neural networks and classify them as parasitized or uninfected.

## Overview
Malaria is a serious global disease and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical and sub-tropical countries. It affects between 200 and 300 million people and causes more than 1 million deaths every year. It becomes the 5th cause of death from infectious diseases worldwide in low  income countries. Yet, malaria is both preventable and curable. How AI can be leveraged for detecting malaria, a deadly disease and focus on building a low-cost, yet effective and accurate open-source solution  For which, it is important to develop an automated image analysis that is able to identify the uninfected and infected RBCs in a blood smear image. 
 
 ## Problem_Definition
A general framework to perform detection of malarial parasite, which includes image preprocessing, extracting infected blood cells, morphological operation and highlighting the infected cells is described. This methodology may serve as a rapid diagnostic tool for malaria, even where the expert in microscopic analysis may not be available.  
Currently, clinical diagnosis primarily utilizes microscopy to study the prepared blood Sample. However, evaluation of sample is Difficult and time consuming, especially in situations where large numbers of samples require reliable analysis.
